Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption

**Objective:**
Develop a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation. 
You can perform operations like swapping pixel values or applying a basic mathematical operation to each pixel. Allow users to encrypt and decrypt images

**Procedure:**
This Python script utilizes the PIL (Python Imaging Library) and NumPy libraries to perform image encryption and decryption. 
Image encryption is achieved through a bitwise XOR operation between the image array and a randomly generated encryption key. 
Decryption is then conducted by applying the same XOR operation with the key.

**Note:** Before running this script, ensure that the PIL (Python Imaging Library) is installed. If it's not installed, you can do so using the command "pip install pillow".
